$String  = "Text";
$Integer = 123456;
$Float	 = 3.1416;
$Bolean	 = True;
$Array	 = array("A", "b", "23");
$Object  = null;

#The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP.
#A common example of using the resource data type is a database call.
#We will not talk about the resource type here, since it is an advanced topic.
